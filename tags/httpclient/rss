      <description>Recently, I had to interact with an external API which is protected by JWT Bearer Tokens. For this, I had to get an access_token first and then set it to each request. But, this can get quite tedious very soon even if you just do it a few times. In the end, I wanted an implementation that encapsulated the need for developers to worry about getting access tokens prior to communicating with the API.</description>
