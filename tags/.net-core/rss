      <description>In this post, I will share with you a solution to a problem that I see often when developing ASP.NET Core apps that use both Fluent Validation and Entity Framework (Core). I&amp;rsquo;ll first set the scene: Show the EF Core Entity + Configuration + Fluent Validation we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on. Next, I&amp;rsquo;ll show the actual problem that emerges with this approach and in the end how can it be improved/solved.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had to interact with an external API which is protected by JWT Bearer Tokens. For this, I had to get an access_token first and then set it to each request. But, this can get quite tedious very soon even if you just do it a few times. In the end, I wanted an implementation that encapsulated the need for developers to worry about getting access tokens prior to communicating with the API.</description>

      <description>The era of .NET developers being constrained on using only Windows as a platform is gone. (At least for ASP.NET). That might be very cool to some, but also scary for others. Fear of change is true. Nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely time (if not yet) to get out of the comfort zone and get your feet wet. Being able to work with .NET on Linux/Mac is one of the points that makes me agree 100% with Nick Craver that .</description>
