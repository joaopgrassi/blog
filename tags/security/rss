      <description>This is the second post in the Authorization in ASP.NET Core series.
  Part 1: Using a middleware to build a permission-based identity in ASP.NET Core
  Part 2: Deep dive into policy-based authorization in ASP.NET Core
  In the previous post, we set the foundation by creating a ClaimsIdentity containing all the logged-in user permissions with the help of a custom middleware.
Before we start using the permissions we built in the last post, I believe it makes sense to review the authorization options the framework provides us and understand how things work under the hood.</description>

      <description>This post is the first in a series about Authorization in ASP.NET Core. I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through a series of approaches you can use to implement authorization in your ASP.NET Core APIs, focusing on advanced/real-world scenarios. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peek for what I plan to show you:
 Where to store and resolve authorization-like data How to protect your API endpoints using permission-based authorization using the built-in types in the framework Reduce duplication and make things smarter by implementing a custom Authentication Handler.</description>
