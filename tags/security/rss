      <description>This post is the first in a series about Authorization in ASP.NET Core. I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through a series of approaches you can use to implement authorization in your ASP.NET Core APIs, focusing on advanced/real-world scenarios. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peek for what I plan to show you:
 Where to store and resolve authorization-like data How to protect your API endpoints using permission-based authorization using the built-in types in the framework Reduce duplication and make things smarter by implementing a custom Authentication Handler.</description>
