We’ll be looking at this from a local development perspective and expand on it later in the next posts.\nTL;DR Used docker-compose, xunit Collection Fixtures and WebApplicationFactory in order to connect to SQL Server running on Docker and create/migrate/drop a new database for each test run.\nIf you want to skip and jump right at the code, check the project on GitHub\nAlternatives to the in-memory database providers If I’m not using the in-memory database providers, then I need to have a full SQL Server instance running on my machine? Not really. We have some options:\n SQL LocalDB SQL Server running on Docker  SQL LocalDB works great but.. it doesn’t work on Linux and you need to install it in your Windows machine. If you use Visual Studio you probably already have it installed but with more and more people using VS Code and Rider as their main IDEs, these options don’t work well.\nIf you don’t know SQL Server is available on Linux for quite some time now. Even better, it’s available as a Docker image. This is very powerful because it enables virtually anyone to have a full-fletched SQL Server running without having to install anything other than Docker.\nSo the answer I chose for my projects is Docker!\nUsing docker-compose for your integration tests We just need a docker-compose.yml file at the root of our repo which starts a SQL Server container for us. If you don’t know what docker-compose is, you can take a look at the official documentation. In very crude terms it’s just a way to tell Docker: run all these things for me and make them work together!\nAn example docker-compose.yml file that starts a SQL Server instance looks like this:\nversion: \"3.7\" networks: blogapp-network: services: blogapp-sqlserver: image: \"mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server\" ports: - \"1433:1433\" environment: SA_PASSWORD: \"2@LaiNw)PDvs^tL!Ybt]6H^%h3UM\" ACCEPT_EULA: \"Y\" networks: - blogapp-network I’ll skip the details on this file since it’s too much for a single post, but the important parts are the image which tells what we want, in this case, SQL Server. The port which is mapping/exposing the port 1433 of the container to the host (our machines) and the password for the sa user.\nWhen you are ready, just execute docker-compose up at the root of your repo using your favorite shell and you are good to go! You have a full SQL Server at your disposal. Next, we’ll see then how to configure your code to use it.\nASP.NET Core integration tests against a real SQL Server For this part, I’m going to use a sample app based on the Blog entities that are in the official EF Core docs. It’s an ASP.NET Core API that has a controller to expose some CRUD operations around a Blog entity. All the code is available on GitHub.\nFor brevity I’ll skip some of the details about integration tests otherwise this will get long. If you are not familiar with it you can get up to speed by reading this: Integration tests in ASP.NET Core\nThe way things come together in a test project is by creating a class deriving from WebApplicationFactory. In this class, we have the possibility to alter our real app in any way we want. For example, in the link above they show you how to switch the registered DbContext with your “real” connection string to an in-memory one during the tests.\nWe’ll be using our container instead of the in-memory providers as you guessed by now. But first, we need to consider some points.\nUnderstanding the lifetime of things during the integration tests Testing code that uses EF Core means that we have to do the following at least once during a test run\n Run the migrations in order to create the database Maybe run some seed method Drop the database when done testing  This is very fast when using the in-memory providers but when using a real SQL Server it’s not so fast anymore. It’s still just within a second or so but you need to think better now when and how many times you want to do it. Because this can drastically impact the speed of your tests.\nDifferent testing frameworks offer different ways to share data across a test run. xunit offers 3 ways:\n Constructor and Dispose (shared setup/cleanup code without sharing object instances) Class Fixtures (shared object instance across tests in a single class) Collection Fixtures (shared object instances across multiple test classes)   Since xunit is the most used test framework in .NET, that’s what I’ll be using for the rest of the post.\n We can use a Collection Fixture in order to create the database once and use the same for all integration tests. Once all tests are finished, we can drop the database.\nYou have to understand though when writing your tests this way that you cannot rely on the state of the database because you don’t know which test executed before and what data it might have modified. For that reason, I always treat each test as if the database was empty and I always insert the data I want to assert first.\nLet’s see how to do this next.\nCreating our DB Collection Fixture using BlogApp.Data; using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore; using System; using Xunit; namespace BlogApp.Api.Tests { public class DbFixture : IDisposable { private readonly BlogDbContext _dbContext; public readonly string BlogDbName = $\"Blog-{Guid.NewGuid()}\"; public readonly string ConnString; private bool _disposed; public DbFixture() { ConnString = $\"Server=localhost,1433;Database={BlogDbName};User=sa;Password=2@LaiNw)PDvs^tL!Ybt]6H^%h3UM\"; var builder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder(); builder.UseSqlServer(ConnString); _dbContext = new BlogDbContext(builder.Options); _dbContext.Database.Migrate(); } public void Dispose() { Dispose(disposing: true); GC.SuppressFinalize(this); } protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) { if (!_disposed) { if (disposing) { // remove the temp db from the server once all tests are done  _dbContext.Database.EnsureDeleted(); } _disposed = true; } } } [CollectionDefinition(\"Database\")] public class DatabaseCollection : ICollectionFixture { // This class has no code, and is never created. Its purpose is simply  // to be the place to apply [CollectionDefinition] and all the  // ICollectionFixture interfaces.  } } The constructor is the important part of this class:\n Initializes a connection string pointing to our SQL Server running on Docker (localhost, 1433) Uses a Guid in the database name in order to create a random one on the server every time Creates a DbContext instance and calls Migrate in order to create the database (applying the migrations)  The fixture also implements IDisposable in order to drop the database at the end of each test run.\nNow we need to create the WebApplicationFactory and use this Fixture there.\nCreating our WebApplicationFactory The WebApplicationFactory is where we can tell ASP.NET Core: When the app requests an instance of a DbContext via DI, use this one. This is how it looks like:\nUpdate - Aug 13 2020 In the original post, I showed you how to use the Docker connection string by removing the original DbContext registration inside the WebApplicationFactory. Alexey pointed out that there are some good benefits of not doing that. A big one that I was not aware, is when using DbContext pooling. In that case, you might have custom configuration and by removing the original registration you are losing that, which defeats the purpose of integration tests.\nAlexey's suggestion on not removing the original DbContext registration  One easy solution is instead of removing the original DbContext registration, we just add an In-memory configuration provider with our integration test connection string. That will override the one in your appsettings.json during the tests. I’ve updated the code snippet below to reflect that along with the project on GitHub. Thanks, Alexey!\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing; using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration; using System.Collections.Generic; using Xunit; namespace BlogApp.Api.Tests { [Collection(\"Database\")] public class BlogWebApplicationFactory : WebApplicationFactory { private readonly DbFixture _dbFixture; public BlogWebApplicationFactory(DbFixture dbFixture) = _dbFixture = dbFixture; protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder) { builder.UseEnvironment(\"Test\"); // UPDATE: No need to remove the original DbContext.  // To use our Docker db, we can just provide an in-memory config provider.\t // The original code is just here for reference.  //builder.ConfigureServices(services =  //{  // // Remove the app's BlogDbContext registration.  // var descriptor = services.SingleOrDefault(  // d = d.ServiceType ==  // typeof(DbContextOptions));  // if (descriptor is object)  // services.Remove(descriptor);  // services.AddDbContext(options =  // {  // // uses the connection string from the fixture  // options.UseSqlServer(_dbFixture.ConnString);  // });  //})  builder.ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) = { config.AddInMemoryCollection(new[] { new KeyValuePairstring, string( \"ConnectionStrings:BlogConnection\", _dbFixture.ConnString) }); }); } } } Let’s go through it:\n  Note the [Collection(\"Database\")] attribute on the class. That tells xunit to inject the database fixture into this class’s constructor.\n  We add an in-memory configuration provider (AddInMemoryCollection) containing our Docker connection string. When the app starts, this will override the connection string in appsettings..json. No need to remove the original DbContext.\n  We have all we need now. Let’s connect all the pieces!\nCreating an integration test This is an example of an integration test class for our Blog controller:\nusing BlogApp.Api.Controllers.Models; using BlogApp.Data.Entities; using FluentAssertions; using System; using System.Net.Http; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Xunit; namespace BlogApp.Api.Tests.Controllers { [Collection(\"Database\")] public sealed class BlogsControllerTests : IClassFixture { private readonly BlogWebApplicationFactory _factory; public BlogsControllerTests(BlogWebApplicationFactory factory) { _factory = factory; } [Fact] public async Task Create_ShouldCreateBlog() { // Arrange  var createRequest = new CreateBlogRequest { Url = \"https://aspnet-core-is-cool.net\" }; var client = _factory.CreateClient(); // Act  var postResponse = await client .PostAsync(\"/v1/blogs\", new JsonContent(createRequest)); var blogCreateResponse = await postResponse.Content.ReadAsJsonAsync(); // Assert - by calling the Get/id and comparing the results  var getResponse = await client .GetAsync($\"/v1/blogs/{blogCreateResponse.Id}\"); var blogGetResponse = await getResponse.Content.ReadAsJsonAsync(); blogGetResponse.Should().BeEquivalentTo(blogCreateResponse); } } } Again let’s inspect things a bit:\n  This class also has the [Collection] attribute the same as the factory. We need this otherwise the factory doesn’t get the Fixture injected since it’s not a test on itself but rather just a normal class.\n  We use another xunit way of sharing data: IClassFixture. This will inject our WebApplicationFactory into the test class’s constructor and the same factory is shared for all tests in this class only\n  Inside the test we use the factory to create the HttpClient which points to our app\n  Next, we issue a POST request to the blog controller to create our blog\n  Then, we issue a GET request using the Id returned\n  Finally, we compare both values to see if they match\n  That’s it! The integration test is succinct and easy to understand. All the inner works of creating/migrating the database and dropping it are hidden away by the Collection Fixture + WebApplicationFactory.\nThe only thing developers working on this project need to do before running the tests is to execute docker-compose up (Assuming Docker is already running).\nSummary In this post we looked at several things so let’s recap a bit:\n  Created our docker-compose.yaml file which contains our SQL Server container\n  Understood the lifetime of a test run in xunit and used a Collection Fixture to manage our database creation/migration/deletion\n  Used a in-memory configuration provider inside our WebApplicationFactory in order to override the connection string present in appsettings..json and use the one connecting to our SQL Server running on Docker.\n  Created an integration test that POST and GET a blog from our SQL Server running on Docker\n  This solution combines the power of Docker containers with techniques to share “things” across tests using xunit and WebApplicationFactory.\nWith the approach I presented in this post, your tests now match better your production environment, thus exposing possible bugs earlier and giving you more confidence when you are ready to deploy your apps.\nComing up next, I’ll show you how you can run the same tests with Docker during your CI Build in Azure DevOps.

Because this can drastically impact the speed of your tests.</p><p>Different testing frameworks offer different ways to share data across a test run. <code>xunit</code> offers 3 ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Constructor and Dispose</strong> (shared setup/cleanup code without sharing object instances)</li><li><strong>Class Fixtures</strong> (shared object instance across tests in a single class)</li><li><strong>Collection Fixtures</strong> (shared object instances across multiple test classes)</li></ul><blockquote><p>Since <code>xunit</code> is the <a href="https://nugettrends.com/packages?months=24&ids=xunit&ids=NUnit&ids=MSTest.TestFramework">most used test framework</a> in .NET, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be using for the rest of the post.</p></blockquote><p>We can use a <code>Collection Fixture</code> in order to create the database once and use the same for all integration tests. Once all tests are finished, we can drop the database.</p><p>You have to understand though when writing your tests this way that <strong>you cannot rely on the state of the database</strong> because you don&rsquo;t know which test executed before and what data it might have modified. For that reason, I always treat each test as if the database was empty and I <em>always insert the data I want to assert first</em>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see how to do this next.</p><h3 id=creating-our-db-collection-fixture>Creating our DB Collection Fixture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creating-our-db-collection-fixture>#</a></h3><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span style=color:#66d9ef>using</span> BlogApp.Data;

A big one that I was not aware, is when using <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-2.0#dbcontext-pooling>DbContext pooling</a>. In that case, you might have custom configuration and by removing the original registration you are losing that, which defeats the purpose of integration tests.</p><figure class=figure-border><img class=img-center src=/using-docker-compose-for-your-asp-net-ef-core-integration-tests/twitter_dbcontext_pooling.png alt="Alexey's suggestion on not removing the original DbContext registration" loading=lazy><figcaption class=img-caption>Alexey's suggestion on not removing the original DbContext registration</figcaption></figure><p>One easy solution is instead of removing the original <code>DbContext</code> registration, we just add an <code>In-memory</code> configuration provider with our integration test connection string.
