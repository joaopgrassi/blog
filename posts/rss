      <description>This is the forth post in the Authorization in ASP.NET Core series.
  Part 1: Using a middleware to build a permission-based identity in ASP.NET Core
  Part 2: Deep dive into policy-based authorization in ASP.NET Core
  Part 3: Protecting your API endpoints with dynamic policies in ASP.NET Core
  Part 4: Adding integration tests for permission-protected API endpoints in ASP.NET Core (this post)
  In the previous post I demonstrated an approach to add authorization to our API endpoints.</description>

      <description>This post is the first in a series about Authorization in ASP.NET Core. I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through a series of approaches you can use to implement authorization in your ASP.NET Core APIs, focusing on advanced/real-world scenarios. Here&amp;rsquo;s a sneak peek for what I plan to show you:
 Where to store and resolve authorization-like data How to protect your API endpoints using permission-based authorization using the built-in types in the framework Reduce duplication and make things smarter by implementing a custom Authentication Handler.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about my recent experience of migrating this very single blog from Ghost to Hugo. More specifically, I want to talk about: Why I decided to migrate; What were the pain points; What were the good points and something about hosting.
So let&amp;rsquo;s start!
Why touch something that works? Isn&amp;rsquo;t this the mantra for us, software ppl?
Jokes aside, when I first started my blog over in 2018 (2 years already, whoa!</description>

      <description>In this post, I will share with you a solution to a problem that I see often when developing ASP.NET Core apps that use both Fluent Validation and Entity Framework (Core). I&amp;rsquo;ll first set the scene: Show the EF Core Entity + Configuration + Fluent Validation we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on. Next, I&amp;rsquo;ll show the actual problem that emerges with this approach and in the end how can it be improved/solved.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: If you are already familiar with Azure Key Vault, App Service/Functions and just want to know how to use the new Key Vault references feature in your app, you can just jump to this section: Create a system-assigned identity for our Function and follow from there.

      <description>Update 18. Dec 2021: The repo on GitHub has been updated to .NET 6. I also &amp;ldquo;containerized&amp;rdquo; all the apps so it&amp;rsquo;s easier to run them. Make sure to check it out! httpclient-token-identityserver
 Recently, I had to interact with an external API which is protected by JWT Bearer Tokens. For this, I had to get an access_token first and then set it to each request. But, this can get quite tedious very soon even if you just do it a few times.</description>

      <description>The database team at my current job had successfully integrated the databases into source control using Redgate SQL Source Control. Developers now have a local instance of the databases linked to Source Control and for them to add or change things it&amp;rsquo;s a breeze.
The &amp;ldquo;adding databases into source control&amp;rdquo; statement is comprised of basically adding all the objects to source control. E.g. Tables, Views, Procedures and so on. Apart from adding database objects, there were also a couple of Tables identified as &amp;ldquo;Enum&amp;rdquo; tables.</description>

      <description>The era of .NET developers being constrained on using only Windows as a platform is gone. (At least for ASP.NET). That might be very cool to some, but also scary for others. Fear of change is true. Nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely time (if not yet) to get out of the comfort zone and get your feet wet. Being able to work with .NET on Linux/Mac is one of the points that makes me agree 100% with Nick Craver that .</description>

      <description>It has been almost two months now since I uploaded my first Chrome extension to the Chrome Store. And now, I finally have a Blog where I can officially talk about it with the world!
TL;DR I have built a Chrome Extension to help developers avoid making mistakes while dealing with &amp;ldquo;Production Like&amp;rdquo; instances of their apps. Click here to see the links
