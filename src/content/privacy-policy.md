## Introduction

This page explains what visiting this site means for your online privacy.

First and foremost, online privacy is something **very important to me**. This site was built with your online privacy
as a priority from the start. This site is entirely Open Source and its code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/joaopgrassi/blog).

Although I have **no interest** in collecting nor sharing any of your data, due to technicalities *some* data might be transmitted.
The next sections describe in detail the scope of such data transmission.

## Accessing this site

### Host provider

Data processor: [Hetzner Online GmbH](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/legal-notice) with servers within Germany/Finland.

When visiting the site, the following data is stored in the host provider's log files:

- Anonymized IP address
- Browser
- Date and time of visit
- Operating system

From the provider's [FAQ](https://docs.hetzner.com/general/general-terms-and-conditions/data-privacy-faq/#which-data-is-stored-in-the-log-files)

> At the web server level, this happens by default by storing an IP address <123.123.123.XXX> in the log file
> instead of the visitor's actual IP address, for example, <123.123.123.123>. The XXX is a random value between 1 and 254,
> so it is no longer possible to establish the true identity of the visitor.

Purposes of processing:

- Ensuring the function of the website
- Traceability and protection against attacks
- Legitimate interest based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR

Data is stored for: **14 days in encrypted backups**.
