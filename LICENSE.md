All markdown (.md) files inside the `content/posts` directory are licensed under

1. The canonical link is directed towards the original article, e.g.

2. The following message is displayed in a visible way above and below the article:
   `This article has been originally published on <a href="https://blog.joaograssi.com/">Joao Grassi's Blog</a>.`

# Images

The images inside the `content/*` and `static/content/*` are part of blog posts. The images can be classified into two categories: 

## Post cover images

These images are **not owned by Joao Grassi**. They are taken from websites like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com). These images sometimes are displayed at the top of a blog post. 

They are **always** included in the [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) tags in order to show post covers in social medial, like Twitter.

The credit of these images is located at the end of the belonging post, in the format indicated by the website where it was originally taken from.

## Screenshots

There are images of screenshots of applications described in the posts. An example of a screenshot might be a screenshot of a configuration page in the Azure Portal (`src/content/posts/2019/keyvault-references-with-azure-functions/adding-accesspolicy.png`
). I don't own the application where the screenshot is shown so no license is attributed to these types of images.
